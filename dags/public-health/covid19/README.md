# City of LA COVID-19 Dashboard README

## Contents
We've documented all the data that feeds into the City of LA COVID-19 Dashboard and listed each source in the [Section 1: Data Sources](#data-sources). We believe that open source data will allow policymakers and local authorities to monitor a rapidly changing situation. It will prevent other entities from "reinventing the wheel". For more technical information on our methodology and workflow, please read through Section 2-5.

Some shelters may be listed that are not yet active, and have inaccurate information. You can remove them by filtering for `status != 0`.

* [Shelter stats](http://lahub.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=9db2e26c98134fae9a6f5c154a1e9ac9) - some aggregate statistics of the current shelter status, including number of unique shelters, number with known status, and number of available beds.

* The relevant script to transform shelter data is: `get-help-to-esri.py`.

## Hospital Bed and Equipment Availability

The County issues a [daily pdf survey](http://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/dhs/1070069_HavBedSummary.pdf) on the number of beds and ventilators that are available, unavailable, or occupied by COVID-19 patients. This survey is manually entered into a [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rS0Vt-kuxwQKoqZBcaOYOOTc5bL1QZqAqqPSyCaMczQ/edit?usp=sharing), and uploaded to the [Bed Availability V4 Layer](http://lahub.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=956e105f422a4c1ba9ce5d215b835951) on ESRI for dashboarding and analysis.
LA County publishes a daily HavBed report that gives aggregate counts for hospital bed availability for medical/surgical, telemetry, and ICU beds, as well as ventilator counts.

## Testing Data

* [City of LA COVID-19 Tests Administered](http://lahub.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=d5aed319c0a747c389db893b9cbd772e)

The relevant script is:

The City collects data on the number of tests performed and test kits available from its several COVID-19 testing sites. The DAG `sync_covid_testing_data.py` collects the data from a [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1agPpAJ5VNqpY50u9RhcPOu7P54AS0NUZhvA2Elmp2m4/edit?usp=sharing), and uploads it to the [LA COVID Testing V5 Layer](http://lahub.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=f00ffb81e4b848b192bc993cd22e0acf) on ESRI for dashboarding and analysis.



## COVID-19 Case Data

The Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering has open sourced data culled from the US CDC, World Health Organization, DXY (China), China CDC (China), Hong Kong Department of Health, Macau Government, Taiwan CDC, European CDC, Government of Canada, Australia Government Department of Health, and other local, state, and regional health authorities. The team at JHU has [written a blog](https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/) about their efforts in providing real-time information in the face of a global public health emergency.

JHU initially published US county-level data until 3/10/2020. On 3/10, JHU started publishing only US state level data ([GitHub issue](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/issues/382)). As a result, there is a major gap in JHU's county time-series data between 3/10-3/23, until they started publishing county-level data again on 3/24 ([GitHub issue](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/issues/1250)). In April, JHU provided historical county time-series data going back to January in their GitHub.

### City of LA Workflow

**4/9/2020 update:** We use Aqueduct, our shared pipeline for building ETLs and scheduling batch jobs. We create one table for the US and one for the rest of the world, called *global*:

* **Global:** Use JHU province-level time-series data. The US is a singular observation as a country. Smaller countries report only country-level data, while larger countries like China, Australia, and Canada include province-level data.
* **US:** Use JHU's historical county-level time-series data up through 4/8. Then, schedule a job that pulls JHU county-level time-series data (which is updated hourly). Append those into one time-series dataset and calculate state totals and change in cases from prior day.
* **MSA Comparison:** An automatic comparison of number of cases per million for key metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) to power our chart in the dashboard. These key MSAs (and CBSA FIPS codes) are: Los Angeles/Orange County (31080), San Francisco/San Jose (41860, 41940), New York City (35620), Seattle (42660), and Detroit (19820).

Our ETLs check JHU data ***every hour***. Our ESRI map layers are public and listed in the [Data Sources section](#data-sources).

## Shelter Data

The DAG `shelter-to-esri.py` takes the Rec & Parks (RAP) shelter census (collected at 8 intervals a day) and pushes it into the City of LA GeoHub by merging it with the the official shelter data from LA Sanitation (LASAN) and RAP GIS staff. The report intervals are: 6:30am, 10:30am, 11:30am, 12:30pm, 1:30pm, 2:30pm, 3:30pm, 4:30pm, and 8:30pm. We do some timezone data cleaning and publish.

`Timestamp` is the time in which the shelter actually submitted the Google form. `Date` and `Time` are which "report" they are filing for.

Note, the capacity numbers should be calculated by `sum(occupied beds + unoccupied beds)`, rather than the normal capacity, which has been lower to help adhere to social distancing in the shelters.

Our ESRI map layers are public and listed in the [Data Sources section](#data-sources).

## GetHelp Shelter Data

The City will be transitioning shelter data management to a system run by [GetHelp](https://gethelp.com). This includes bed counts, shelter service information, and historical data. The DAG `get-help-to-esri.py` loads shelter data from the GetHelp shelter management platform and uploads it to Esri for GIS analysis and dashboarding. API documentation for the GetHelp system can be found in
[this Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z2i0-aPrw-dqSJLpkXrDRIJS_1noqxxEM0QBwl6yLTU/edit?ts=5e8e13e3#gid=0). This DAG deliberately outputs similar ESRI feature layers to the above approach using the Google Form. Our ESRI map layers are public and listed in the [Data Sources section](#data-sources).


## Prior Updates to Workflow
### COVID-19 Case Data
**4/1/2020 update:** To reconcile the mutiple schemas from JHU and NYT for our US table, we use Aqueduct, our shared pipeline for building ETLs and scheduling batch jobs.

* **US:** Use NYT county-level time-series data up through 3/31. Then, schedule a job that pulls JHU county-level time-series data (which is updated hourly). Append those into one time-series dataset and calculate state totals.

**3/13/2020 update:** JHU's CSVs will be at the state level, and not at the city/county level anymore, [as noted in their GitHub issue](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/issues/382). Since JHU's feature layers weren't connecting to our dashboard, we adapted our ETL to continue to grab province/state level data for the world and will publish these as 2 public ESRI feature layers (#1, #2). Our ETL checks JHU data ***every hour***.

In addition, we are scraping the websites for Southern California counties belonging in the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) region. We have data from [Los Angeles](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/), [Orange County](http://www.ochealthinfo.com/phs/about/epidasmt/epi/dip/prevention/novel_coronavirus), and [Imperial](http://www.icphd.org/health-information-and-resources/healthy-facts/covid-19/) Counties. In the coming days, we will add [Ventura](https://www.ventura.org/covid19/), [Riverside](https://www.rivcoph.org/coronavirus), and [San Bernardino](http://wp.sbcounty.gov/dph/coronavirus/) Counties. We have combined JHU county data up to 3/12/2020 with our own compilation of counts, and will publish these as 2 public ESRI feature layers (#3, #4). Our ETL scrapes case counts published by county public health agency websites ***every hour***.

1. Worldwide time-series data available at the state level of confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered.
2. Worldwide *current date's* data available at the state level of confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered.
3. SCAG Region time-series data available at the county level of confirmed cases, travel-related cases, and community spread cases. Not all counties report the breakdown due to travel vs. community spread, but we grab it if it's available.
4. SCAG Region *current date's* data available at the county level of confirmed cases, travel-related cases, and community spread cases.

**3/12/2020 update:** JHU publishes new CSVs daily with city/county level counts for the world. Starting from 3/10/2020, the JHU dataset includes both county-level and state-level observations. [JHU GitHub issue discussing this change.](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/issues/559) We schedule our ETL around these CSVs made available on GitHub and repackage them into 2 public ESRI feature layers:
1. Time-series data available at the city/county level of confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered.
2. The *current date's* city/county data of confirmed cases, deaths. In the coming days, we hope to update or publish a new feature layer that contains the state's and country's total cases, deaths, and recovered.
